In this class, our focus is physical science, but we also explore earth and life sciences. The best way to learn science is through experience, so we will complete a number of hands-on projects and experiments this year.

## Class Content

**Physics:**\
Apple, meet gravity. In this unit, we will study the forces and laws which govern the world we live in. We will do this through labs and simulations to build a deeper understanding of these concepts.

**Chemistry:**\
We will take a very close look at the building blocks of all matter and how they react with one another to create the world around us. We will also explore how these reactions can be observed with the human eye - no microscope needed!

**Earth Science:**\
Have you ever wondered where those glorious Rocky Mountains came from? We’re going to find out through an exploration of the geologic history of the earth. We’ll use fossils, tectonic movements, volcanos, and earthquakes as our key to understanding the earth on a geologic scale. We’ll extend our learning even further (literally) to better understand our place in the solar system.

**Life Science:**\
Do we really matter? According to life science, yes. In this unit, we’ll discover how humans interact with the environment. Life is about give and take, so we’ll look at systematic relationships and how organisms rely on each other to survive.

## Class Projects

**Soda Bottle Rocket:**\
Houston, we have lift off! For this project, you’ll join the space race by designing, iterating, and testing a soda bottle rocket. You’ll need to record your test data and analyze your results to ensure a successful launch.

**Crime Scene Chemistry:**\
There’s been a horrible burglary and it’s your job to ID the perp! This chemistry unit will revolve around the chemistry of a criminal investigation. We’ll spend most of the fourth quarter solving this crime by digging deep into our understanding of chemistry and genetics.

**Conservation Campaign:**\
Here in Colorado conservation of water and electricity is a constant concern. Do you even know where your water and electricity come from? Through research, you’ll find the answers to these questions and identify different methods to conserve both in your everyday life. As a capstone to the unit, you will create a conservation campaign to spread awareness about the ways we can all conserve water and energy.

**Zombie Catapult:**\
What better way to combine students' knowledge of forces, motion, and levers than to create a trebuchet to try to stop the approaching zombie horde? Not for the faint of heart, this project will naturally take place around Halloween.

**Hands on Labs:**\
The best way to learn science is to do science. As such, you’ll spend a lot of time in this class completing labs to experience the concepts we learn about first-hand. Safety goggles required!

**Digital Simulations:**\
Ready to take the safety goggles off? That’s fine. We will also have the opportunity to bring concepts and theories to life with digital simulations.
