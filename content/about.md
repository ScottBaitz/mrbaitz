In this class we focus largely on Physical Science, but we also explore Earth Science and Life Science. The best way to learn science is by actually actually doing science, and because of this we will be performing a lot of experiments in our class, as well as participating in many projects in order to get hands on with the learning.

## Class Content
__Physics:__  
In the Physics unit we will be studying and exploring the forces and laws which govern the world we live in. We will be doing this through hands on experiences which help build a lasting understanding

__Chemistry:__  
In the Chemistry unit we will be looking at the building blocks of all matter, and how they react with one another to create the world around us. We will also explore how these reactions can be observed with the human eye.

__Earth Science:__  
In the Earth Sciences unit we will be looking at the geologic history of the earth using fossils, tectonic movement, and volcanic / earthquake activity. We will also take a short trip to explore our solar system. 

__Life Science:__  
During the life science unit, students will be exploring how humans and the environment interact with one another and rely on the other. We will be exploring systematic relationships.

__Critical Thinking:__  
Students will be working on various labs and activity which will help the students work on creating connections between content, and to think about the implications on the content in their daily lives.

__New Concepts:__  
The focus of our year is to explore new concepts and create new connections. We will be exploring new themes and concepts in science and how they can be applied to our daily lives.

## Class Projects
__Soda Bottle Rocket:__  
The final project for our physics unit will be designing, iterating, and testing a soda bottle rocket. Students will design their rockets from start to finish using their knowledge of physics which they have gained throughout the semester. They will be recording their test data, and analyzing their results to determine how effective their rocket was.

__Crime Scene Chemistry:__  
Our Chemistry unit will be entirely built around the chemistry of a criminal investigation. The 4th quarter will start with a murder, and we will build our knowledge of chemistry through the lens of this criminal investigation. This project will take us through the end of the quart and cover beyond chemistry, and into genetics.

__Conservation Campaign:__  
Here in Colorado conservation of water and electricity is a constant concern. Students will be researching where our electricity and water comes from, and different methods to conserve both in their everyday life. Students will then be creating a campaign to potentially post around the school to share their research.

__Zombie Catapult:__  
Near Halloween students will be working on forces, motion, and levers. What better way to combine students knowledge of physics and levers than to create a trebuchet to try stop the zombie horde.

__Hands on Labs:__  
I believe that the best way to learn science is to do science. In this class students will be completing hands on labs which help reinforce the concepts they will be learning in class, and seeing how these concepts play out in practice.

__Digital Simulations:__  
Digital simulations allow us to explore concepts and scientific theories which are too immense to explore in the classroom. By using simulations, students can have experiences with concepts that otherwise would be entirely theoretical.
